      <p xml:id="p1">Worst case dimensioning and modeling of reliable real-time multihop wireless sensor network</p>
      <p>Kambiz Mizanian, Hamed Yousefi, Amir Hossein Jahangir</p>
      <p xml:id="p2">ABSTRACT</p>
      <p xml:id="p3">Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) should be capable of fulfilling its mission, in a timely manner and without loss of important information. In this paper, we propose a new analytical model for calculating RRT (Reliable Real-Time) degree in multihop WSNs, where RRT degree describes the percentage of real-time data that the network can reliably deliver on time from any source to its destination. Also, packet loss probability is modeled as a function of the probability of link failure when the buffer is full and the probability of node failure when node’s energy is depleted. Most of the network properties are considered as random variables and a queuing theory based model is derived. In this model, the effect of network load on the packets’ delay, RRT degree, and node’s energy depletion rate are considered. Also network calculus is tailored and extended so that a worst case analysis of the delay and queue quantities in sensor networks is possible. Simulation results are used to validate the proposed model. The simulation results agree very well with the model.</p>
      <p xml:id="p4">1. Introduction</p>
      <p xml:id="p5">Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are self-organized ad hoc networks, which are equipped with limited computing and radio communication capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib1">1</ref>. Nodes are capable of sensing, gathering, processing and communicating data, especially the data pertaining to the physical medium in which they are embedded. It is envisioned that a typical WSN consists of a large number of nodes <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib1">1</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib2">2</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib3">3</ref>. A typical network configuration consists of sensors working unattended and transmitting their observed or sensed values to some processing or control center, the so-called sink or base station node, which serves as a user interface. Due to the limited transmission range, sensors that are far away from the sink deliver their data through <hi rend="italic">multihop</hi> communications, i.e. using intermediate nodes as relays. In this case, a sensor may be both a data source and a data router.</p>
      <p xml:id="p6">Although energy efficiency is usually the primary concern in WSNs, the requirement of low latency communication is getting more and more important in emerging applications. Out-of-date information will be irrelevant and even leads to negative effects on system monitoring and control. Real-time (RT) sensor systems have many applications especially in intruder tracking, medical care, fire monitoring and structural health diagnosis.</p>
      <p xml:id="p7">WSN differs dramatically from the traditional RT systems due to its wireless nature, limited resources (power, processing and memory), low node reliability and dynamic network topology. Thus, developing real-time applications over WSN should consider not only resource constraints, but also the node and communication reliability and the globally time varying network performance.</p>
      <p xml:id="p8">This paper establishes a probabilistic fundamental quantitative notion for performance-critical applications on real-time information transfer in multihop wireless networks. However, bounded delay latency is extremely dependent on path reliability when any lost packet must be retransmitted and it can cause additional delivery delay. Here, the packet loss probability is the probability of one path’s link failure when node’s buffer in the end point of the link is full and there is no space for new packets or the probability of one path’s node failure when node’s energy is depleted and the node does not have any energy for taking more transmissions.</p>
      <p xml:id="p9">Application areas for sensor networks might be production surveillance, traffic management, medical care or military applications. In these areas it is crucial to ensure that the sensor network is functioning even in a worst case scenario. It must be clear that the sensor network can support all possible communication patterns that might occur in the network without being overloaded. If a sensor network is used for example for production surveillance it must be ensured that messages indicating a dangerous condition are not dropped. If functionality in worst case scenarios cannot be proven, people might be in danger and the production system might not be certified by authorities.</p>
      <p xml:id="p10">As it may be difficult or even impossible to produce the worst case in a real world scenario or in a simulation in a controlled fashion an analytical framework is desirable that allows a worst case analysis in sensor networks. Network calculus <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib4">4</ref> is a relatively new tool that allows worst case analysis of packet-switched communication networks. Network calculus has successfully been applied to model wired IP-based networks built on QoS technologies like Integrated Services or Differentiated Services <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib5">5</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib6">6</ref>.</p>
      <p xml:id="p11">In this paper it is shown how network calculus can be tailored and extended so that a worst case analysis of the delay and queue quantities in sensor networks is possible. Also, we propose a new probabilistic analytical model for calculating RRT (Reliable Real-Time) degree in multihop WSNs, where RRT degree describes the percentage of real-time data that the network can reliably deliver on time from any source to its destination. Analytical expressions for reliable real-time degree facilitate the process of designing a WSN that is guaranteed to meet specified throughput and delay requirements. These expressions describe values of a set of variables that will enable the network to meet anticipated soft real-time requirements. In other words, they define the feasibility region in the space of such variables. In the event of dynamically changing network, which is expected in WSN, besides planning and designing, the feasibility region allows optimization of the operation of the network.</p>
      <p xml:id="p12">Thus, the purpose of this paper is to perform a probabilistic analysis of Reliable Real-time Degree in wireless sensor network, which considers the packet loss and packet delay as real-time measures, and node failure and link failure as reliability metrics. The effect of network load is also examined. Also network calculus is tailored and extended so that a worst case analysis of the delay and queue quantities in sensor networks is possible.</p>
      <p xml:id="p13">The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 a literature survey is presented. In Section the preliminaries and assumption of the problem are clarified. In Section a model for evaluating the reliable real-time degree is derived. In Section network calculus is tailored and extended so that a worst case and bound analysis of the delay and queue quantities in sensor networks is possible. Section presents the simulation results and Section provides some conclusions and future work.</p>
      <p xml:id="p14">2. Related work</p>
      <p xml:id="p15">A large amount of research on sensor networks has been recently reported, ranging from studies on network capacity and signal processing techniques, to algorithms for traffic routing, topology management and channel access control.</p>
      <p xml:id="p16">With regard to analytical studies, results on the capacity of large stationary ad hoc networks are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib7">7</ref> (note that sensor networks can be viewed as large ad hoc networks, but WSNs almost are stationary and all nodes send messages to few sinks). In <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib7">7</ref> two network scenarios are studied: one including arbitrarily located nodes and traffic patterns, the other one with randomly located nodes and traffic patterns. The case of tree-like sensor networks is studied in <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib8">8</ref>, where the authors present optimal strategies for data distribution and data collection, and analytically evaluate the time performance of their solution. An analytical approach to coverage and connectivity of sensor grids is introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib9">9</ref>. The sensors are unreliable and fail with a certain probability leading to random grid networks. Results on coverage and connectivity are derived as functions of key parameters such as the number of nodes and their transmission radius. Some researchers have looked at latency issues from different perspectives. For instance, the approach of Intanagonwiwat et al. <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib10">10</ref> exploits latency and credibility trade-off in order to propose a solution to the problem of How long a node should wait before aggregating and sending its data to its parent? where a parent denotes the next hop. Another in-network data aggregation scheme that aims at minimizing the end-to-end delay is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib11">11</ref>. This scheme does not consider any latency bound but tries to minimize the average end-to-end delay by concatenating multiple packets into one at MAC layer. The idea is to limit the medium access contention so that the packet queuing delay be reduced. Moreover, they use a feedback mechanism at each sensor node to adjust the number of concatenated packets based on the current traffic conditions. In <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib12">12</ref> Abdelzaher et al.a sufficient condition for schedulability under fixed-priority scheduling which allows capacity planning to be employed prior to deployment such that real-time requirements are met at run-time. The bound is derived for load balanced networks, as well as networks where all traffic congregates at a number of sinks. The approach of Chiasserini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib13">13</ref> exploits several performance metrics, among which the distributions of the data delivery delay. They consider that the information sensed by a network node is organized into data units of fixed size, and can be stored at the sensor in a buffer of infinite capacity. They assume that wireless channel is error-free. In <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib14">14</ref> Chiasserini et al. presented a methodology to analyze the behavior of large-scale sensor networks. Their approach was based on a fluid representation of all quantities that depend on the specific location within the network topology, and on probabilistic functions to characterize the behavior of individual nodes. They did not consider the battery discharge of the sensors and the behavior of the nodes dependent on their residual energy. In <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib15">15</ref> we proposed a quantitative real-time model for WSNs, and described real-time degree by considering the packet loss and packet delay as real-time measures. However, this model does not consider the probability of node failure due to node energy depletion and its effect on path reliability and real-timeliness in WSNs.</p>

To compute the network load at a sensor node, we note that, because of packet loss probability at the sensor node, the load will be reduced at each successive node from source to a destination. For example, in the ith node, i=0, 1, 2, . . . E[N]-1, this traffic exists in the case of traversing all previous i-1 nodes without packet loss.

      <p xml:id="p75">Now, for evaluating the reliable real-time degree of a path, we employ the following reasoning:</p>
      <p xml:id="p76">If the path does not fail, as long as the values of packet loss and packets’ delay do not exceed a specific threshold, the reliable real-time degree is equal to one. When these values exceed their thresholds, the value of reliable real-time degree has inverse relation with the packet loss and delay to their threshold. Now, if this path fails, with some probability, a spare path is chosen, and then the reliable real-time degree of this new path determines the reliable real-time degree of the previous one.</p>
      <p xml:id="p77">However, packet loss and delay have different units of measurement and we cannot apply mathematical operation on both of them simultaneously. Therefore we embed the effect of packet loss into the notion of delay: when a packet loss occurs and the source receives a NACK, or does not receive an ACK and a timeout occurs, a random time interval between 1 and <formula><m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="K" display="inline"><m:semantics><m:ci id="p77.m1.1" xref="p77.m1.1.pmml">𝐾</m:ci><m:annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Presentation"><m:mi id="p77.m1.1.pmml" xref="p77.m1.1">K</m:mi></m:annotation-xml><m:annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math></formula> elapses and then the packet is retransmitted.

      <p xml:id="p100">5. Evaluation of delay and queue bound</p>
      <p xml:id="p101">Different applications running on top of a sensor network might have different requirements regarding the information extracted from the field. One important requirement is a bound on the maximum <hi rend="italic">information transfer delay</hi> for data delivery. If information is delayed too long on the transport path, the application cannot use the information as it is considered outdated. At each hop of the transport path, a message can be delayed. If a sensor node that generates a message is some hops away from the sink, the message delay accumulates over the hops. If several messages are delayed in one node at the same time, buffer space for the messages must be available. Thus, information transfer delay is correlated with the <hi rend="italic">buffer requirements</hi> of a sensor node. The delay in each node is caused by two interdependent aspects. First, the delay depends on the traffic that a node has to process (<hi rend="italic">arrival rate</hi>). Second, the node needs a specific amount of time to receive process and send a message (<hi rend="italic">service rate</hi>). The first aspect depends on the <hi rend="italic">network topology</hi>, as the traffic that enters a node might be generated by several other nodes. The second aspect is dominated by the <hi rend="italic">reception delay</hi>.</p>
      <p xml:id="p102">In the remaining it is shown how network calculus can be tailored and extended so that a worst case analysis of the relevant quantities in sensor networks is possible.</p>
      <p xml:id="p103">5. <hi rend="italic">1. Background on network calculus</hi></p>
      <p xml:id="p104">Network calculus is a tool to analyze flow control problems in networks with particular focus on determination of bounds on worst case performance. It has been successfully applied as a framework to derive deterministic guarantees on throughput, delay, and to ensure zero loss in packet-switched networks <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib4">4</ref>. Network Calculus is a mathematical tool based on min-plus and max-plus algebras for designing and analyzing deterministic queuing systems <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib4">4</ref>.</p>
      <p xml:id="p105">What makes it different from traditional queuing theory is that it is concerned with worst case rather than average case or equilibrium behavior. It thus deals with bounding processes called arrival and service curves rather than arrival and departure processes themselves.

      <p xml:id="p122">In this paper the common class of single base station oriented operation models is assumed. Within the trafc that is modeled only the sensor reports are taken into account. Traffic generated from the base station towards the nodes (e.g. interests <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib23">23</ref> to set up the network structure and configure the nodes) is explicitly not taken into account. This is considered feasible based on the assumption that the traffic flowing towards the sensors is magnitudes lower than traffic caused by the sensing events. Furthermore, it is assumed that the routing protocol being used forms a tree in the sensor network.

      <p>Due to the traffic aggregation inside the network the concatenation result cannot be applied directly, there is in fact a way to still derive a network-wide service curve based on modified service curves that take into account the effects of cross- traffic on a data flow <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib4">4</ref>. However, the bounds achieved in this way are not necessarily lower than for . This depends on the actual parameters of arrival and service curves. Furthermore, we believe that the hop-by-hop calculation will lend itself better towards integrating in-network processing into future, more elaborate extensions of the model.</p>

      <p>Note that the assumption is made that each sensor node has its individual arrival curve respectively maximum sensing rate. This arrival curve can be used in situations where all sensor nodes are set up to periodically report the condition in a sensor field. Thereby each sensor has a maximum possible rate with which the sensing information can be reported.</p>
      <p xml:id="p135"><hi rend="italic">Average sensing rate</hi>. Depending on the sensor network application the maximum sensing rate arrival curve might lead to very conservative bounds if the maximum sensing rate is only rarely the actual sensing rate. In this situation it would be much more useful if the arrival curve could be based on the average sensing rate. Additionally, there should be permission of some short-term fluctuations if the sensing must be intensified for certain periods of high activity in the field. However, in order to avoid the use of the maximum sensing rate arrival curve it is crucial that the time during which the average sensing rate may be exceeded can be upper bounded. In many applications that should be possible since after some time the phenomenon will disappear again or has to be acted on such that it disappears again (e.g. in a sensor network that also comprises actuators).

This service curve is typically used for servers that provide a bandwidth guarantee with certain latency. The latency T refers to the deviation of the service (e.g. blocking factor of non-preemptive transmissions). This is often also called a rate-latency service curve and results from the use of many popular packet schedulers (for example Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib24">24</ref>) many of which can be generalized as guaranteed rate or latency rate schedulers <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib25">25</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib26">26</ref>. While for sensor networks there may often be neither a necessity nor the resources (e.g. energy, computational power, memory capacity) for a sophisticated scheduling algorithm like WFQ, the class of rate-latency service curves is still very interesting. This is due to the fact that the latency term nicely captures the characteristics induced by the application of a duty cycle concept. Whenever the duty cycle approach is applied there is the chance that sensed data or data to be forwarded just arrives after the last duty cycle (of the next hop) is just over and thus a fixed latency occurs until the forwarding capacity is available again. So, with some new parameters the following service curve at sensor node i is obtained:</p>

      <p xml:id="p146">For the routing protocol, the Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) protocol is used <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib27">27</ref>. All nodes in GPSR must be aware of their position within a sensor field. Each node communicates its current position periodically to its neighbors through beacon packets. In the given static scenario, these beacons have to be transmitted only once. Upon receiving a data packet, a node analyzes its geographic destination. If possible, the node always forwards the packet to the neighbor geographically closest to the packet destination. If there is no neighbor geographically closer to the destination, the protocol tries to route around the hole in the sensor field. This routing around a hole is not used in the described topology. In Fig. 7 the resulting structure of the communication paths is shown.</p>

      <p xml:id="p154">In this section we use GloMoSim <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib28">28</ref> to study the reliable real-time degree of wireless sensor networks.</p>
      <p xml:id="p155">GloMoSim is a scalable discrete-event simulator developed by UCLA. This software provides a high fidelity simulation for wireless communication with detailed propagation, radio and MAC layers. describes the detailed setup for our simulator. The communication parameters are mostly chosen in reference to the Berkeley Mote <ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib29">29</ref> specification.</p>
      <p xml:id="p156">There are two typical traffic patterns in sensor networks: a base station pattern and a peer-to-peer pattern.</p>
      <p xml:id="p157">In our evaluation, we use a base station scenario, where 6 nodes, randomly chosen from the left side of the terrain, send data to the base station at the middle of the right side of the terrain. The average hop count between the node and base station is about 89 hops. Each node generates flow with a rate of 1 packet/second. In order to evaluate the end-to-end delay we increase the rate of this flow step by step from 1 to 100 packets/second over several simulations.</p>
      <p xml:id="p158">plot shows the end-to-end delay. At each point, we average the end-to-end delays of all the packets from the 96 flows (16 runs with 6 flows each). As you can see in , by increasing the packet transmission rate, end-to-end delay increases as well. As the rate increases, the buffer full probability increases as well and the lost packets must be retransmitted until they are successfully delivered to the sink.</p>
      <p xml:id="p159">Fig.9 shows the miss ratio. We assume that <formula><m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="T_{Delay}" display="inline"><m:semantics><m:apply id="p159.m1.10" xref="p159.m1.10.pmml"><m:csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="p159.m1.1" xref="p159.m1.10.pmml">subscript</m:csymbol><m:ci id="p159.m1.2" xref="p159.m1.2.pmml">𝑇</m:ci><m:apply id="p159.m1.9" xref="p159.m1.9.pmml"><m:times id="p159.m1.3" xref="p159.m1.3.pmml"/><m:ci id="p159.m1.4" xref="p159.m1.4.pmml">𝐷</m:ci><m:ci id="p159.m1.5" xref="p159.m1.5.pmml">𝑒</m:ci><m:ci id="p159.m1.6" xref="p159.m1.6.pmml">𝑙</m:ci><m:ci id="p159.m1.7" xref="p159.m1.7.pmml">𝑎</m:ci><m:ci id="p159.m1.8" xref="p159.m1.8.pmml">𝑦</m:ci></m:apply></m:apply><m:annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Presentation"><m:msub id="p159.m1.10.pmml" xref="p159.m1.10"><m:mi id="p159.m1.2.pmml" xref="p159.m1.2">T</m:mi><m:mrow id="p159.m1.9.pmml" xref="p159.m1.9"><m:mi id="p159.m1.4.pmml" xref="p159.m1.4">D</m:mi><m:mo id="p159.m1.3.pmml" xref="p159.m1.3">⁢</m:mo><m:mi id="p159.m1.5.pmml" xref="p159.m1.5">e</m:mi><m:mo id="p159.m1.3a.pmml" xref="p159.m1.3">⁢</m:mo><m:mi id="p159.m1.6.pmml" xref="p159.m1.6">l</m:mi><m:mo id="p159.m1.3b.pmml" xref="p159.m1.3">⁢</m:mo><m:mi id="p159.m1.7.pmml" xref="p159.m1.7">a</m:mi><m:mo id="p159.m1.3c.pmml" xref="p159.m1.3">⁢</m:mo><m:mi id="p159.m1.8.pmml" xref="p159.m1.8">y</m:mi></m:mrow></m:msub></m:annotation-xml><m:annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T_{Delay}</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math></formula> is 150 ms, and as can be seen in , by increasing the packet trans- mission rate, miss ratio increases as well. The reason is that when the rate increases, then the average end-to-end delays will increase too.</p>
      <p xml:id="p160">The reliable real-time degree is a metric in soft real-time systems. We set the buffer size to 50 packets. In the simulation, some packets are lost due to full buffer. We also consider this situation as a deadline miss. The result shown in is the summary of 16 randomized runs. When the packet rate increases, the buffer full probability and node failure probability increase as well. Hence the packet loss increases too. Another consequence of the rate increase is the end-to-end delay augmentation. So the packet rate increscent, yields a decrease of reliable real-time degree (percentage of on time successfully delivered data).</p>

      <p xml:id="p163">We introduced in this paper a metric, reliable real-time degree, based on a queuing theory model for general-case wireless sensor network in which the nodes are <formula><m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="M/M/1/k" display="inline"><m:semantics><m:apply id="p163.m1.6" xref="p163.m1.6.pmml"><m:divide id="p163.m1.1" xref="p163.m1.1.pmml"/><m:ci id="p163.m1.2" xref="p163.m1.2.pmml">𝑀</m:ci><m:ci id="p163.m1.3" xref="p163.m1.3.pmml">𝑀</m:ci><m:cn type="integer" id="p163.m1.4" xref="p163.m1.4.pmml">1</m:cn><m:ci id="p163.m1.5" xref="p163.m1.5.pmml">𝑘</m:ci></m:apply><m:annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Presentation"><m:mrow id="p163.m1.6.pmml" xref="p163.m1.6"><m:mi id="p163.m1.2.pmml" xref="p163.m1.2">M</m:mi><m:mo id="p163.m1.1.pmml" xref="p163.m1.1">/</m:mo><m:mi id="p163.m1.3.pmml" xref="p163.m1.3">M</m:mi><m:mo id="p163.m1.1a.pmml" xref="p163.m1.1">/</m:mo><m:mn id="p163.m1.4.pmml" xref="p163.m1.4">1</m:mn><m:mo id="p163.m1.1b.pmml" xref="p163.m1.1">/</m:mo><m:mi id="p163.m1.5.pmml" xref="p163.m1.5">k</m:mi></m:mrow></m:annotation-xml><m:annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M/M/1/k</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math></formula> queues. Parameters such as packet loss, packets’ delay and path lifetime were considered as important factor in determining the reliable real-time degree of such network. We have analyzed a semi-qualitative phenomenon, so that we can predict the real-time behavior of network in the case of stochastic events. Simulation results are in accordance with the model. It was shown that increasing the network load has a negative impact on the reliable real-time degree.
</p>
      <p xml:id="p164">Also we use network calculus and extended it, so that a worst case analysis of the delay and queue quantities in sensor network is possible, and we can predict the bounded value of delay and buffer.</p>
      <p xml:id="p165">The model could be modified to take into account some aspects that have not been addressed in this work and that can be interesting subject of future research. For instance, a model of other queuing policy or firm real-time can be included and some of the assumptions that we made while developing the analytical model, such as those on all the nodes are active and none of them in sleep mode, can be modified. Furthermore, we point out that the model can be extended to describe various aspects in the design of sensor networks, such as data aggregation or back pressure traffic mechanisms. Finally, cluster-based network architectures as well as the case where the network topology varies could be studied.</p>
