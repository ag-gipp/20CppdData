      <p xml:id="p2">Polymer translocation through a nanopore in a membrane is investigated theoretically. Recent experiments on voltage-driven DNA and RNA translocations through a nanopore indicate that the size and geometry of the pore are important factors in polymer dynamics. A theoretical approach is presented which explicitly takes into account the effect of the nanopore length and diameter for polymer motion across the membrane. It is shown that the length of the pore is crucial for polymer translocation dynamics. The present model predicts that for realistic conditions (long nanopores and large external fields) there are two regimes of translocation depending on polymer size: for polymer chains larger than the pore length, the velocity oftranslocation is nearly constant, while for polymer chains smaller than the pore length the velocity increases with decreasing polymer size. These results agree with experimental data.</p>

      <p xml:id="p4">Translocation of polymers across a nanopore plays a critical role in numerous natural phenomena and industrial processes. Many biological phenomena, such as the motion of DNA and RNA molecules across nuclear pores, virus infection of cells, DNA packaging into viral capsids, gene swapping, and protein transport through membrane channels, involve the motion of biopolymers across membranes<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib1">1</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib2">2</ref>. In chemistry, the forced permeation of polymer molecules and electrophoresis are crucial for separations and purifications of synthetic as well as biological macromolecules. The motion of polymers in a confined medium is also technologically important in food and medicine production, in oil recovery and separation, and in many other industrial processes. Accordingly, the mechanisms of polymer translocation have become a subject of numerous experimental<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib3">3</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib4">4</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib5">5</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib6">6</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib7">7</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib8">8</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib9">9</ref> and theoretical studies<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib10">10</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib11">11</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib12">12</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib13">13</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib14">14</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib15">15</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib16">16</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib17">17</ref>.

      <p xml:id="p5">A polymer molecule moving across a nanopore faces a large entropic barrier due to the decrease in the number of available configurations for polymer segments. In order to overcome this barrier and to speed up the motion of polymers, an external field or interaction is needed.

These elegant experiments are based on the following simple idea. When a polymer molecule moves through a nanopore, the electric current in the system nearly vanishes because the polymer blocks the flow of free ions through the channel. Accurate recordings of cur- rent blockages allow the description of the dynamics of translocation of single polymer molecules. The principal experimental findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the ability of polymers to enter the nanopore depends linearly on polymer concentration and exponentially on applied voltage;<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib3">3</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib6">6</ref> (ii) there is a critical value of the external electric potential below which no polymer molecule can enter and move through the nanopore;<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib6">6</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib7">7</ref> (iii) the effective number of free charges on a translocating polymer is surprisingly very small in comparison with the number of available charges;<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib6">6</ref> (iv) there are two regimes of polymer threading through the nanopore depending on polymer length-long polymers move across the membrane with nearly constant velocity, while short polymers move significantly faster;<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib7">7</ref> (v) the nanopore length defines the boundary between short and long polymers.<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib7">7</ref> These last two experimental observations are the subject of the present theoretical investigations.</p>

Theoretical approaches to polymer translocation mainly follows three directions. In one approach<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib10">10</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib14">14</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib17">17</ref>, the moving polymer molecule should over- come the entropic barrier, and the free energies of polymer segments determine the dynamics of translocation. Another approach<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib13">13</ref> focuses on the interaction between the polymer and the nanopore, and neglects the entropic contributions from polymer segments outside the nanopore. The last approac<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib16">16</ref> views the polymer translocation as the motion of a kink, which travels in the direction opposite to polymer transport. All these theoretical works provide a reasonable description of polymer threading through the nanopore for very large polymers. However, these theories are less successful in understanding the dynamics of relatively short polymers due to the fact that they view the nanopore as an object which can hold only one monomer (with the exception of Ref. 17, as discussed below).

The theoretical approach of Amb-jÃ¶rnsson et al.<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib17">17</ref> takes into account the nanopore length and studies both the polymer entrance into the pore and the trans- location process. However, only ideal flexible polymers are considered and theoretical analysis focused on the dependence of polymer translocation dynamics on external electric field.</p>
      <p xml:id="p7">In this work the effects of the nanopore length and diameter on the threading dynamics of single polymer molecules are investigated. The goal is to develop the simplest theoretical description of translocation process which takes into account the geometry of the nanopore and interactions between the nanopore and polymer molecule. In the present model the polymer moves across the membrane as shown in Fig. 1. The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we develop a model and calculate ffee energies and translocation times for translocating polymers of different sizes. In Sec. III we apply our results for the description of experimental translocations of voltage-driven DNA molecules. Our theoretical analysis is summarized in Sec. IV.</p>

The potential energy change is considered to occur only across the nanopore. The exact functional form for potential drop inside the nanopore is unknown due to complex geometry and interactions inside the pore. For simplicity, we assume that the potential inside the nanopore is uniform. This picture yields a very large electric field (gradient of the potential) at the upper and lower pore mouths. However, this assumption is still reasonable for the following reasons. The electric fields at the entrance into the pore and at the exit from the pore are not infinite since the potential changes over the monomer length distance, and charged monomers are the subject of these vary large fields for only very short periods of time. In addition, for typical experimental voltages of 50- 100 mV<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib3">3</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib4">4</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib5">5</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib6">6</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib7">7</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib8">8</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib9">9</ref>, the energy of stretching in the upper and lower pore mouths will be in the order of 5-10 kJ/mole, which is much less than the chemical bond energy in the molecule, and thus the polymer will not tear apart.

      <p xml:id="p12">In this case, there are three regimes of motion, as shown in Fig. 2(a). In regime I, the leading monomer enters the nanopore from the upper region and then moves across the nanopore. In regime II, the leading monomer leaves the nanopore, while the end monomer approaches the entrance of the pore. In regime III, the end monomer goes through the nanopore and finally leaves it for the lower region. In our model, we consider the overall translocation process as three independent, sequential processes, i.e., the polymer molecule passes first through regime I, then it goes through regime II and finally passes through regime III. As soon as the polymer enters into regime II, it is not allowed to diffuse back to regime I; similarly, after entering regime III, it will never return back to regime II. At given experimental conditions, this assumption is reasonable since the energy gain of moving a single monomer from upper chamber into the pore, or from the pore into the lower chamber (see Fig. 1), is still larger than thermal energy and, as a first approximation, the backward motion between regimes can be neglected.</p>

dynamics of the polymer molecule in regime II. The contribution from the fluctuating polymer segments inside the pore is always constant in this regime because the number of monomers inside the nanopore does not change. Then this free energy term will not affect translocation times since they are determined by free energy differences [ see Eqs. (15), (16), (17)]. In regimes I and III the number of monomers inside the nanopore is changing, however the free energy difference from this confinement term is equal to <formula><m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="k_{B}TD^{-1/\nu}," display="inline"><m:semantics><m:apply id="p68.m1.1" xref="p68.m1.2a.pmml"><m:times id="p68.m1.1.1" xref="p68.m1.1.1.pmml"/><m:apply id="p68.m1.1.5" xref="p68.m1.1.5.pmml"><m:csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="p68.m1.1.2" xref="p68.m1.1.5.pmml">subscript</m:csymbol><m:ci id="p68.m1.1.3" xref="p68.m1.1.3.pmml">𝑘</m:ci><m:ci id="p68.m1.1.4" xref="p68.m1.1.4.pmml">𝐵</m:ci></m:apply><m:ci id="p68.m1.1.6" xref="p68.m1.1.6.pmml">𝑇</m:ci><m:apply id="p68.m1.1.15" xref="p68.m1.1.15.pmml"><m:csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="p68.m1.1.7" xref="p68.m1.1.15.pmml">superscript</m:csymbol><m:ci id="p68.m1.1.8" xref="p68.m1.1.8.pmml">𝐷</m:ci><m:apply id="p68.m1.1.14" xref="p68.m1.1.14.pmml"><m:minus id="p68.m1.1.9" xref="p68.m1.1.9.pmml"/><m:apply id="p68.m1.1.13" xref="p68.m1.1.13.pmml"><m:divide id="p68.m1.1.10" xref="p68.m1.1.10.pmml"/><m:cn type="integer" id="p68.m1.1.11" xref="p68.m1.1.11.pmml">1</m:cn><m:ci id="p68.m1.1.12" xref="p68.m1.1.12.pmml">𝜈</m:ci></m:apply></m:apply></m:apply></m:apply><m:annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Presentation"><m:mrow id="p68.m1.2a.pmml" xref="p68.m1.1"><m:mrow id="p68.m1.1.pmml" xref="p68.m1.1"><m:msub id="p68.m1.1.5.pmml" xref="p68.m1.1.5"><m:mi id="p68.m1.1.3.pmml" xref="p68.m1.1.3">k</m:mi><m:mi id="p68.m1.1.4.pmml" xref="p68.m1.1.4">B</m:mi></m:msub><m:mo id="p68.m1.1.1.pmml" xref="p68.m1.1.1">⁢</m:mo><m:mi id="p68.m1.1.6.pmml" xref="p68.m1.1.6">T</m:mi><m:mo id="p68.m1.1.1a.pmml" xref="p68.m1.1.1">⁢</m:mo><m:msup id="p68.m1.1.15.pmml" xref="p68.m1.1.15"><m:mi id="p68.m1.1.8.pmml" xref="p68.m1.1.8">D</m:mi><m:mrow id="p68.m1.1.14.pmml" xref="p68.m1.1.14"><m:mo id="p68.m1.1.9.pmml" xref="p68.m1.1.9">-</m:mo><m:mrow id="p68.m1.1.13.pmml" xref="p68.m1.1.13"><m:mn id="p68.m1.1.11.pmml" xref="p68.m1.1.11">1</m:mn><m:mo id="p68.m1.1.10.pmml" xref="p68.m1.1.10">/</m:mo><m:mi id="p68.m1.1.12.pmml" xref="p68.m1.1.12">ν</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:msup></m:mrow><m:mo id="p68.m1.2.pmml" xref="p68.m1.1">,</m:mo></m:mrow></m:annotation-xml><m:annotation encoding="application/x-tex">k_{B}TD^{-1/\nu},</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math></formula> which for experimental conditions<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib3">3</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib5">5</ref><ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib6">6</ref> is very small in comparison with entropic and chemical potential terms, and can be neglected.

The authors also showed that the blockade level is proportional to the fractional volume of the channel occupied by the polymer. This means that in these experiments the translocation process started when 35% of the polymer entered into the nanopore, and ended when only 35% of the polymer left in the pore. Thus, in order to compare our the- oretical predictions with experimental observations, the ex- pressions for translocation velocity (30) should be modified as follows:</p>

Then the expressions (31) can be used to fit the observed translocation velocities<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib7">7</ref> as shown in Fig. 3. The present theoretical approach predicts two types of translocation depending on polymer size. For large polymers, larger than the nanopore length, the translocation velocity approaches a constant value, while for short polymers the velocity increases significantly with decreasing polymer length. These predictions are in excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with experiments for large polymers; however, for short polymers the agreement is only qualitative.</p>

These results agree with our physical picture, that the rate constants are determined by the interaction between the polymer molecule and the nanopore. For short polymers the interaction with the pore is smaller and as a result the rate constant increases over 300 times. Note, that the friction co- efficient here, most probably, is not a linear function of the number of the monomers in the pore, but the dependence is much stronger.</p>

In addition, our descriptions of the nanopore geometry and the potential changes inside the nanopore are very simplified. However, for short polymer molecules these factors probably influence the translocation dynamics much stronger than for large polymers. Also, the dependence of the rate constants on the number of polymer segments inside the nanopore has been neglected, which probably has a stronger effect on the short polymers. Another possible reason for the deviation of theoretical predictions from the measurements for short polymers is the fact that in <formula><m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="\mathrm{e}\mathrm{x}\mathrm{p}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{r}\mathrm{i}\mathrm{m}\mathrm{%&#10;e}\mathrm{n}\mathrm{t}\mathrm{s}^{7}" display="inline"><m:semantics><m:apply id="p80.m2.4" xref="p80.m2.4.pmml"><m:csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="p80.m2.1" xref="p80.m2.4.pmml">superscript</m:csymbol><m:ci id="p80.m2.2" xref="p80.m2.2.pmml">experiments</m:ci><m:cn type="integer" id="p80.m2.3" xref="p80.m2.3.pmml">7</m:cn></m:apply><m:annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Presentation"><m:msup id="p80.m2.4.pmml" xref="p80.m2.4"><m:mi id="p80.m2.2.pmml" xref="p80.m2.2">experiments</m:mi><m:mn id="p80.m2.3.pmml" xref="p80.m2.3">7</m:mn></m:msup></m:annotation-xml><m:annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{e}\mathrm{x}\mathrm{p}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{r}\mathrm{i}\mathrm{m}\mathrm{%

As was observed,7 this distribution is not symmetric about the peak, and thus the reported translocation times differ from mean times utilized in our approach. This asymmetry apparently has a stronger effect for short polymers. Despite these discrepancies, the fact that a very simple theoretical approach can provide a qualitative and semiquantitative description of complex translocation processes is rather encouraging. It also indicates that the presented theoretical model correctly captures and describes the main features of translocation phenomena.</p>

      <p xml:id="p84">IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</p>
      <p xml:id="p85">A simple theoretical model of polymer translocation through the long nanopores driven by external electric fields is presented. The fact that we take into account the nanopore length and diameter allows us to describe the translocation dynamics for polymer molecules of different sizes. By con- sidering in detail different regimes of moving polymers across the membranes, the general expressions for free energies and translocation times for polymer chains threading through the nanopores are derived. The presented theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results on voltage-driven translocation of single-stranded DNA molecules through the ahemolysin protein channels<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib7">7</ref>. It is found that for experimental conditions<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib7">7</ref>, long polymers, longer than the nanopore length, translocate with nearly constant velocity, while short polymers move significantly faster. The the- oretical analysis indicates that for experiments<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib7">7</ref> with ahemolysin protein channels the polymer fluctuations inside the nanopore do not affect the translocation dynamics. Presented theoretical results are in agreement with experimental observations.</p>
      <p xml:id="p86">Although we have provided a reasonable description of polymer translocation experiments<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib7">7</ref>, there are many factors that have not been taking into account. We assumed in our calculations that the external field inside the nanopore is uniform, but a more realistic picture would incorporate a potential profile inside the nanopore<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib17">17</ref>, which can be found by taking into account the realistic geometry of the nanopore</p>
      <p xml:id="p87">and all electrostatic interactions. In the present model, the possibility that the polymer molecule can return was neglected, which is a very good approximation at large external driving fields, as realized in most experiments. Our theoretical approach allows us to consider this effect by solving the Smoluchovskii equations (6) with different boundary conditions. We also assumed that the nanopore is very narrow, i.e., the effect of the nanopore diameter on the free energies of the polymer segments outside of the pore has not been considered, although the ahemolysin pore in principle can hold several monomers of DNA or RNA molecules. Probably, the simplest way to include this possibility into the model we have presented, is to utilize the scaling approach<ref type="bibr" target="bib.bib20">20</ref>.</p>
